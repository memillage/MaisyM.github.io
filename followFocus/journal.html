        Week I

	        Initially, I tried using Visual Studio with the Platform.io library and provided code from the makefab's github. After 
		adding the code, I ran it, but unfortunately the board wasn't being programmed. After a few more attempts, it still 
		didn't work so I switched to the Arduino IDE. I again used the given code and DW1000 library from the previously 
		mentioned makerfab github. I tried adding the ports, but they weren't showing up. After switching the cables plugged 
		into the computer, it finaly registered the ports and the boards. I also initially had the incorrect baud rate so the 
		output was incorrect. Once I changed it, the correct outputs displayed, showing the distance between the two UWB 
		devices. I then converted the output from meters to feet. The current outputs are not very accurate and will need 
		to be calabrated through testing.

	<div class = "entry">
		I bought the incorrect power cables to connect to the 12V source. The ones I got were 5.5 x 5.1 power jacks, but I 
		needed 5.5 x 2.5. In addition, the gears I received to use with the lens do not fit on the motor shaft of the Nema 17. 
		To meditate the issue, I bought ridge flange shaft couplings which I will connect to the gear and place onto the 
		motor shaft. To conceptualize the idea, I created a 3D model with the dimensions of each item as seen in figure 1.

	<div class = "entry">
		After I created the model, I decided to design a part (figure 2) which will be 3D printed. It is designed to be 
		attached to the bottom of the motor (figure 3) and screwed to the camera rig accessory with a theaded heat insert.
